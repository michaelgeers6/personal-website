My research investigates the psychology of consumer judgment and decision making. Specifically, I seek to better understand the intersection between consumer behavior and online technologies, currently pertaining to misinformation and microtargeting, and to develop interventions to mitigate these challenges. To achieve this, I use a combination of online and field experimental methods, and draw on insights from consumer research, psychology, and computational social science.

**Research on Understanding Digital Challenges**

My research investigates when and why consumers are susceptible to believing and sharing misinformation. First, to better understand belief in misinformation, my co-authors and I examine how aware consumers are of their own errors in detecting political misinformation. We find that people across the political and ideological spectrum have good insight into their ability to distinguish between accurate political information and falsehoods, with one exception: Levels of metacognitive insight were considerably lower for Republicans and conservatives for incongruent news---that is, when the information in question challenged their ideological commitments (Geers et al., 2023). In two related projects, we find that actively open-minded thinking is a better predictor of susceptibility to misinformation than the popular Cognitive Reflection Test ([Roozenbeek et al., 2022](http://journal.sjdm.org/22/220228/jdm220228.pdf)), and that time pressures increases susceptibility to misinformation but does not alter response bias ([Sultan et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26209-8)). Second, to better understand the spread of misinformation, in hybrid lab-field study on Twitter my co-authors and I explore how motives for sharing differ across users and relate to content features (see also [Geers, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44159-023-00215-7)).

**Research on Empowering Consumers Online**

In a related line of research, my co-authors and I seek to empower consumer behavior online. Specifically, we aim to strengthen peopleâ€™s resilience to microtargeting---manipulative ads that target people based on aspects of their personality---by getting them to reflect on their own personality first. We have shown that people can learn to identify ads that target them ([Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94796-z)), and we are now in the process of testing whether better detection of targeting attenuates its impact---both in the commercial and political realm. In more conceptual work, with an international group of experts we review interventions against misinformation and manipulation online ([Kozyreva et al., 2022](https://psyarxiv.com/x8ejt)). My research on microtargeting and misinformation has important implications for empowering consumers in an increasingly digital world.
