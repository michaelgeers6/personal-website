I am a behavioral marketing researcher and a fourth-year PhD student in Psychology at the [Center for Adaptive Rationality (ARC)](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality) at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en) in Berlin.

My research primarily focuses on consumer behavior in digital environments, currently pertaining to misinformation and microtargeting.

Prior to joining ARC, I earned a Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania. I also completed an MSc in Marketing with distinction (Trinity College Dublin) and a BA in Business Administration (Provadis School of International Management and Technology).

I am on the 2023--2024 job market for assistant faculty and postdoc positions.
